# Folder: data_input

This folder contains the scripts for importing the real-world datasets. 

Reading and processing the real-world data always starts with script preprocess_datasets.py. In this script, the correct read script can be commented out, which should be read_dialect_glucose.py for the DIALECT-2 data and read_movies.py for the MovieLens dataset.

The input_data and preprocessed data for DIALECT-2 is not actually stored in this repository, since it is sensitive. The input_data for MovieLens can be accessed both in this repository and online.
