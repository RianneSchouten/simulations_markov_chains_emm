# folder: data_input

This folder contains the scripts to read the real-world data. 

Reading and processing the real-world data always starts with script preprocess_datasets.py. In this script, the correct read script can be commented out, which should be read_dialect_glucose.py for the Dialect data. 

The input_data and preprocessed data is not actually stored in this repository, since it is sensitive. The preprocessed dataset is the one that is loaded in main_real_world_data_orders.py.
