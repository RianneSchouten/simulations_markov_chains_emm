# Folder: figures

This folder contains all visualizations for the manuscript `Mining Sequences with Exceptional Transition Behaviour of Varying Order using Quality Measures based on Information-Theoretic Scoring Functions'. 

In additions, the figures for three earlier versions are stored in a separate folder. 

Figures for the synthetic data experiments are generated with Figures_manuscript_finalized.R.

Figures for the experiments with DIALECT-2 are generated with ../figures_dialect_finalized.py.
