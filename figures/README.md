# folder: figures

This folder contains all visualizations for the manuscript `Mining sequences with exceptional transition behaviour of varying order using quality measures based on information-theoretic scoring functions'. You can find these figures in the folder Figures_manuscript.

In additions, the figures for two earlier versions are stored here. Figures for a draft of the same paper are stored in Figures_firstpaperdraft. Figures for the Work In Progress paper `mining exceptional sequences using log likelihood based quality measures' are stored in Visualizations_wip. There are furthermore some trial visualizations from other datasets in Visualizations_otherdatasets.

Figures for the synthetic data experiments are generated with Figures.R.

Figures for the experiments with DIALECT-2 are generated with ../figures_dialect.py.

All other figures are made with two older scripts: figures.py and figures_functions.py.
