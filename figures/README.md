# Folder: figures

This folder contains all visualizations for the manuscript `Mining Sequences with Exceptional Transition Behaviour of Varying Order using Quality Measures based on Information-Theoretic Scoring Functions'. You can find the figures for the revised manuscript (May 2021) in the folder Figures_revised_manuscript.

In additions, the figures for three earlier versions are stored here. Figures for a draft of the same paper are stored in Figures_firstpaperdraft. Figures for the Work In Progress paper `Mining exceptional sequences using log likelihood based quality measures' are stored in Visualizations_wip. Figures for the first manuscript are stored in Figures_manuscript. 

Figures for the synthetic data experiments are generated with Figures_revised_manuscript.R.

Figures for the experiments with DIALECT-2 are generated with ../figures_dialect_version2.py.
