# Folder: data_output

This folder contains the output of all experiments, both synthetic data experiments and real-world experiments for the manuscript `Mining Sequences with Exceptional Transition Behaviour of Varying Order using Quality Measures based on Information-Theoretic Scoring Functions'. The folder also contains the output of earlier experiments.

The main results can be found in the folder: results_revised_manuscript (May 2021). The output of the real-world data experiments is stored in the subfolder real_world_data_experiments. The two files starting with `TIRpatientendata...' contain the results of the DIALECT-2 experiments. Here, number 2 corresponds to the experiments with long sequences (experiment 6.1.1 in the manuscript) and number 1 corresponds to the experiments with short sequences (experiment 6.1.2 in the manuscript).
