# folder: data_output

This folder contains the output of all experiments, both synthetic data experiments and real-world experiments for the manuscript `'. The folder also contains the output of earlier experiments.

The main results can be found in the folder: results_manuscript. In this folder, the synthetic data experiments are stored in excel files starting with `experiment_higherorders...' or with `experiment_zero_order...'. The latter corresponds to the experiments for setting `order = I' as discussed in the manuscript.

The real-worl output for the Dialect study is stored in the two files starting with `TIRpatientendata...'. Here, number 2 corresponds to the experiments with long sequences (experiment 1 in the manuscript) and number 1 corresponds to the experiments with short sequences (experiment 2 in the manuscript).
